#Donovan Mitchell, star guard of the Utah Jazz shot 80.5% from the free throw line last season. After working hard on his shot all
#offseason, he is now an 85% FT shooter. Donovan shoots 500 free throws after practice every day.
#Because of fatigue, his percentage goes down by 1 percentage point for after every 100 free throw attempts (ie for free throws 
#1-100, he is an 85% shooter, for 101-200, he is 84%, and so on). Write a function that takes someone's free throw percentage
#and returns the number of free throws that performs makes in a day if he takes 500 under the conditions described above.






#Joe Ingles has often been compared to a math teacher due to his looks. However, he is also a remarkable statistician. He knows that
#Donovan's freethrow percentage goes down with time, so he bets Donovan dinner that he can't make 85% of his free throws over the
#500 after practice (425 makes). Using your function, run a simulation study to calculate the probability Donovan wins the bet
#(by making >=425 free throws). Be sure to assess monte carlo error.





#The Utah Jazz had an incredible 2018-2019 season and made it to the NBA finals against the Boston Celtics. Celtics coach Brad
#Stevens is not only a basketball prodigy, but has a trick up his sleeve. Inspired by the plot of Celtic Pride, Stevens
#kidnaps Mitchell and replaces him with a Celtic fan look alike. After practice, the Mitchell-look-alike lines up to shoot his
#500 free throws. The Donovan impersonator has practiced his free throw shooting for this moment and is an 80% free throw shooter.
#He also exhibits the 1 percentage point decrease with each 100 free throws. The Jazz will realize that he is an imposter if
#he makes fewer than 400 of his 500 attempts. What is the probability that Jazz will will realize the impersonator
#is an imposter (also know as the power of the test)?
